# IDS Anomaly Detection

Unsupervised network intrusion detection using the CIC-IDS-2018 dataset.  
This project explores anomaly detection, clustering, and representation learning techniques on flow-based network traffic data.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on CIC-IDS-2018
- Analyze temporal traffic patterns
- Investigate feature redundancy and skewness
- Implement unsupervised anomaly detection methods
- Explore representation learning approaches (e.g., autoencoders)

## 🗂 Dataset

CIC-IDS-2018  
Source: Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity  
Flow-based network traffic with labeled attack scenarios.

Note: Raw dataset is not included due to size (~6GB+).

## 🧠 Methods (Planned / In Progress)

- Temporal aggregation (1-minute flow windows)
- Correlation analysis
- Dimensionality reduction
- Unsupervised anomaly detection
- Representation learning

## 📊 Current Status

- EDA complete
- Feature inspection and preprocessing implemented
- Next step: baseline anomaly detection modeling

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- (Future: Scikit-learn / PyTorch)
